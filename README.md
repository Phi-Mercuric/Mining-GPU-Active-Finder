# Mining-GPU-Active-Finder
<p>
	Bash script that indexes gpu profitability sites and compares them to the average price the graphics cards go for on ebay <br> <br>
	Mining profitability changes rapidly and unexpectedly with advent of new coins and changing prices, and that profitability changes from GPU to GPU, and the <i>REAL</i> prices (the prices that you can actually get for cards, not unobtainable MSRP) of those GPUs change day to day. This makes it very hard to keep on top of the latest trends and what cards are the best for the money you put in. <br> <br>
	<h3>Features:</h3>
</p>
	<ul>
		<li> Finds frequently updated graphics card prices adjusted for power consumption (at $0.1 per kWh) </li>
		<li> Good ebay searching (finds only graphics cards that works) that shows updates prices in "buy now" </li>
		<li> Updates for most profitable coins for the specific cards are (due to the website's OP factor) </li>
		<li> Shows days to ROI, profit per day, and average cost of the card </li>
	</ul>
<br>
<p><b>Note: At this moment, this does in incorperate EBAY shipping costs.</b></p>
<br>
<h3>Drawbacks:</h3> 
<p>
	There will be somewhat more risk from buying from EBAY and if you are a big man with big farms, there is only a certain amount that you can buy from ebay without increasing risk or cost. <br> <br>
	Always cross check the chart with the links provided and double check with other benchmarking sites to make sure the results are accurate. This is supposed to be used to help find a card to research more.

<br>
Note: this does mean that this includes used cards very frequently (there very well may be new ones, though). 
<br> <br>
Also don't underestimate the power of ebay; it shows what cards actually go for, not the MSRP that you will never get, and used cards have lower impact on mining than one may assume.
